                <h2 id="page">What is this page?</h2>
                <p>I am currently taking a fullstack web development course at Impacta and the first module is about front-end web development, so we're now studying mostly HTML, CSS and Javascript. I created this page so I could practice the knowledge I have been acquiring, and also make it my first project on GitHub. The idea is to start a portfolium, adding new projects as I learn new technologies and increse my knowledge. This page is not meant to be formal nor substitute my curriculum, but anyway, I will use it to present myself and my studies.</p>

                <h2 id="me">Who am I?</h2>
                <p>I am a student at Federal University of ABC. I am a step to graduate in Science & Technology Bachelor, which is a needed graduation before you can .... At high school I found out I really liked math, and that I liked to keep thinking about math problems, even if I couldn't solve some of them. I even intended to be a math teacher for some time, since I always liked to explain the subjects I knew for other students and friends (that's also why I am a monitor at university, helping other students at exercises related to programming logic). Anyway, computer science had always been an option too. At university I had contact with programming logic and enjoyed it a lot, that was what made me finally choose my computer science graduation, a choice I do not regret. </p>

                <h2 id="objectives">What are my objectives?</h2>
                <p>Nothing describes better my main objective now than "get into the programming world". I'm ALWAYS willing to learn new things, and I'm studying a lot to be part of it. I'm also looking for a job (specially as an intern) so I can experience how is the schedule of a programmer, and also be in contact to real systems, seeing they working in a real application. </p>
